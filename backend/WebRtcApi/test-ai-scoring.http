  "studentResponse": "Task 1 Response:\nThe chart shows the percentage of households in owned and rented accommodation in England and Wales from 1918 to 2011. In 1918, about 23% of households owned their accommodation, while 77% rented. The percentage of owned accommodation increased steadily over the years, reaching about 69% in 2001, then slightly decreased to about 68% in 2011. Conversely, the percentage of rented accommodation decreased from 77% in 1918 to about 32% in 2011.\n\nTask 2 Response:\nSome people believe that educating boys and girls in separate schools is more beneficial. They argue that single-sex schools allow students to focus better on their studies without distractions from the opposite gender. Additionally, they claim that boys and girls have different learning styles and needs, which can be better addressed in separate environments.\n\nHowever, others think that mixed schools provide better preparation for real life. In mixed schools, students learn to interact with both genders, which helps them develop better social skills. Furthermore, mixed schools can provide a more diverse learning environment where students can learn from different perspectives.\n\nIn my opinion, mixed schools are more beneficial because they prepare students for the real world where they will work and interact with people of both genders. While single-sex schools might have some advantages, the social skills gained in mixed schools are more valuable for students' future success.",
